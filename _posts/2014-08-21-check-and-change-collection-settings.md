As a consultant, Iâ€™m generally going into environments and have no clue how things are set up. For collections, I want to know things like how many collections have incremental updates set up, what are the limiting collections, maintenance windows, power plans, and collection variables.

Believe it or not, I wrote a script to gather this information for me! I also added in the ability to change the limiting collection of the selected collections and / or change the incremental update setting.

*Note: Really I wrote this tool to change limiting collections and incremental updates, but realized it would take me 30 seconds to add in all the other information, so I did. You can also find most of this information (everything but incremental updates) in the console by adding columns to the collection view.
